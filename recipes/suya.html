<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Grilled beef skewers from West Africa. Sirloin steak is marinated in a quick and easy marinade that is extremely delicious and perfect for cooking on the grill.</p>
    <p>This incredibly flavorful, West African-style skewer started out as a geographically appropriate main course to pair with a batch of Jollof rice, but quickly turned into my new favorite marinade for beef.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup creamy natural peanut butter</li>
